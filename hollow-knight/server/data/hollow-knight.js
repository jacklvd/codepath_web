When he discovered Hegemol sleeping in his armoured shell, he took it for himself, hoping for the great strength that wearing the armour seemed to promise. Even though madness did not drive him to do this, False Knight eventually fell to the Infection's control",

This birth condition was also supposed to leave them without a mind, will, and voice, to prevent the Radiance from influencing them. However, their purity was misjudged, tarnished by an idea instilled, a bond with the Pale King who raised them.",
